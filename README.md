 
# CSCrashCourse

This repository contains the project that was worked on during our first workshop: C# Crash Course.
 
Each commit corresponds to a section in the workshop, so you can check the [commit history](https://github.com/Beyhum/CSCrashCourse/commits/master) and follow up on each change step by step. 

Please keep in mind that the purpose of this project is to highlight the basic concepts of C# and its differences/similarities with other Object-Oriented languages.
 
Do not consider this project as an ideal reference on how to build a robust Console Application.
